# VigilanteVehicles
Unreal Engine 5.1 repository containing Chaos Vehicle implementations of some of the tracked vehicle models from Vigilante. This project was created for a demo for the Shockworks subsystem for procedural explosion audio. It also proved to be a good test-bed for experimenting with vehicle audio implementation.
